"""Data generator generates batches of inputs and outputs/labels for training.

The inputs are each made from two parts. The first maxlend words are the original description, followed by `eos` followed by the headline which we want to predict, except for the last word in the headline which is always `eos` and then `empty` padding until `maxlen` words.

For each, input, the output is the headline words (without the start `eos` but with the ending `eos`) padded with `empty` words up to `maxlenh` words. The output is also expanded to be y-hot encoding of each word.

To be more realistic, the second part of the input should be the result of generation and not the original headline.
Instead we will flip just `nflips` words to be from the generator, but even this is too hard and instead
implement flipping in a naive way (which consumes less time.) Using the full input (description + eos + headline) generate predictions for outputs. For nflips random words from the output, replace the original word with the word with highest probability from the prediction.
